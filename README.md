# PySnake - A Simple Snake Game in Python

## Overview
PySnake is a classic snake game implemented in Python. The game involves controlling a snake to eat apples, which makes the snake grow longer. The game ends if the snake collides with itself. The game is played in the terminal and features a customizable game board size.

## Features
- **Customizable Game Board**: Set the height and width of the game board.
- **Simple Controls**: Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to control the snake's direction.
- **Terminal-Based**: Play the game directly in your terminal.
- **Dynamic Apple Spawning**: Apples spawn randomly on the board, ensuring they don't overlap with the snake.

## How to Play
1. Run the `snek.py` script:
